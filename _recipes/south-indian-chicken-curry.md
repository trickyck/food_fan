## Instructions

1. **Temper spices**  
   In a large pan, heat oil over medium heat. Add mustard seeds and cumin seeds; let them pop (about 30 seconds).

2. **Sauté aromatics**  
   Add leeks, ginger, garlic (or garlic oil), and chili. Cook for 2–3 minutes until soft and fragrant.

3. **Spice it up**  
   Stir in turmeric, coriander, and garam masala. Cook for 1 minute to toast the spices.

4. **Add chicken**  
   Add chicken thigh pieces. Sauté for 5–6 minutes until lightly browned on all sides.

5. **Add vegetables**  
   Stir in carrots, sweet potato, and zucchini. Mix well to coat everything in the spices.

6. **Simmer in coconut milk**  
   Pour in coconut milk. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and vegetables are tender.

7. **Add lentils (optional)**  
   Stir in the cooked lentils. Simmer another 5 minutes. Season to taste.

8. **Finish and serve**  
   Stir in lemon juice and garnish with fresh coriander or curry leaves. Serve warm.
