## Instructions

1. **Cook the pasta**  
   Cook according to the package instructions. Reserve 1/4 cup of the cooking water, then drain.

2. **Sauté the vegetables**  
   In a large skillet, heat garlic-infused olive oil over medium heat. Add mushrooms and zucchini, and cook for 5–7 minutes until soft and golden. Season with thyme, salt, pepper, and lemon zest.

3. **Wilt the spinach**  
   Stir in baby spinach and cook until just wilted (about 1 minute).

4. **Combine with pasta**  
   Add the cooked pasta and reserved pasta water to the pan. Stir in mozzarella and yogurt to create a light, creamy sauce.

5. **Finish with Parmesan**  
   Turn off the heat and mix in the Parmesan. Taste and adjust seasoning.
