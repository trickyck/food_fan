## Instructions

1. **Sauté the vegetables**  
   In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the grated carrot, zucchini, and leek. Cook for 5–7 minutes, until softened. Add garlic (or garlic oil) and stir for 30 seconds.

2. **Brown the beef**  
   Push the vegetables to one side of the pan. Add the beef mince and cook until browned, breaking it apart with a spoon (6–8 minutes).

3. **Add mushrooms**  
   Stir in the chopped mushrooms. Cook for 8–10 minutes, until they release moisture and reduce in volume.

4. **Build flavor**  
   Add the tomato paste, smoked paprika, cumin, and chili flakes. Cook for 1–2 minutes to intensify the flavors.

5. **Simmer the sauce**  
   Pour in the crushed tomatoes and add the cooked lentils. Season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 15–20 minutes, until thickened. Add a splash of water if needed.

6. **Finish and serve**  
   Stir in a splash of balsamic vinegar or red wine (if using). Taste and adjust seasoning. Garnish with fresh herbs and serve warm.
